# Train-Scheduler

Using Firebase to host train schedules

On Page Load, the train schedule will populate with the data that is stored in the database.

Every time new information about another train is added, that train will be added to the top of the train schedule.

First Train time refers to the first time that train starts on any given day, in military time.
